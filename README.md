Title: Stock Portfolio Analysis and Investment Recommendation System

Problem Statement:

Develop an automated system for analyzing stock portfolios, assessing their risk and return characteristics, and providing investment recommendations based on various technical indicators and machine learning models.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive system that allows users to:

Retrieve historical stock data for a given set of symbols from Yahoo Finance API.
Calculate key financial metrics such as daily returns, volatility, correlation, moving averages (Simple and Exponential), and risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio).
Visualize the risk-return profile of individual stocks and the portfolio as a whole.
Generate buy/sell signals based on technical indicators like moving average crossovers.
Construct and optimize a diversified portfolio based on user-defined weights.
Predict future stock prices using machine learning models such as Linear Regression.
Provide investment recommendations based on predicted price movements and risk tolerance of the user.
